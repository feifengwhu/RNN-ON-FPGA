WARNING: [Timing 38-242] The property HD.CLK_SRC of clock port "clock" is not set. In out-of-context mode, this prevents timing estimation for clock delay/skew

WARNING: [Route 35-39] The design did not meet timing requirements. Please run report_timing_summary for detailed reports.
Resolution: Verify that the timing was met or had small violations at all previous steps (synthesis, placement, power_opt, and phys_opt). Run report_timing_summary and analyze individual timing paths.
INFO: [Route 35-253] TNS is the sum of the worst slack violation on every endpoint in the design. Review the paths with the biggest WNS violations in the timing reports and modify your constraints or your design to improve both WNS and TNS.

INFO: [Timing 38-191] Multithreading enabled for timing update using a maximum of 8 CPUs
WARNING: [Timing 38-242] The property HD.CLK_SRC of clock port "clock" is not set. In out-of-context mode, this prevents timing estimation for clock delay/skew
Resolution: Set the HD.CLK_SRC property of the out-of-context port to the location of the clock buffer instance in the top-level design
