Phase 11 Post Router Timing
WARNING: [Timing 38-242] The property HD.CLK_SRC of clock port "clock" is not set. In out-of-context mode, this prevents timing estimation for clock delay/skew
Resolution: Set the HD.CLK_SRC property of the out-of-context port to the location of the clock buffer instance in the top-level design
