A simply described but highly chaotic dynamical system called the analog shift map is presented, which has computational power beyond the Turing limit (super-Turing); it computes exactly like neural networks and analog machines. This dynamical system is conjectured to describe natural physical phenomenal.},

	abstract = {According to the Church-Turing Thesis, the classical Turing machine model is capable of capturing all possible aspects of algorithmic computation. However, in neural computation, several basic neural models were proven to be capable of computational capabilities located beyond the Turing limits. In this context, we present an overview of recent results concerning the super-Turing computational power of recurrent neural networks, and show that recurrent neural networks provide a suitable and natural model of computation beyond the Turing limits. We nevertheless don't draw any hasty conclusion about the controversial issue of a possible predominance of biological intelligence over the potentialities of artificial intelligence.},
