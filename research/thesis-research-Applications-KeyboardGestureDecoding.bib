abstract = {Gesture typing is an efficient input method for phones and tablets using continuous traces created by a pointed object (e.g., finger or stylus). Translating such continuous gestures into textual input is a challenging task as gesture inputs exhibit many features found in speech and handwriting such as high variability, co-articulation and elision. In this work, we address these challenges with a hybrid approach, combining a variant of recurrent networks, namely Long Short Term Memories [1] with conventional Finite State Transducer decoding [2]. Results using our approach show considerable improvement relative to a baseline shape-matching-based system, amounting to 4{\%} and 22{\%} absolute improvement respectively for small and large lexicon decoding on real datasets and 2{\%} on a synthetic large scale dataset.},
